# Probability Distribution

## Discrete Probability Distribution (PD)
Probability Mass Function
```{r}
set.seed(1)
# Students Study Hours in a day
studyHours <- sample(0:8, size = 20, replace = TRUE)

# Frequency
table(studyHours)

# PD
pdStudyHours <- table(studyHours)/length(studyHours)

```

### Plots

```{r}
barplot(
  pdStudyHours,
  main = "Probability Distribution of Study Hours",
  xlab = "Study Hours",
  ylab = "Probability",
  col = "lightgreen",
  names.arg = names(pdStudyHours)
)
```
